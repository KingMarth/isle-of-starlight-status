Corrected from previous turn: Butler James' and Dewdrop's missed turns (which put James at gatherer 3 by the beginning of this turn). Sorry, don't know how I missed those actions.
That was almost a real mess with the bridge to the mountains! The earlier instance of someone casting a build spell on a structure without all materials present was me making a mistake.
